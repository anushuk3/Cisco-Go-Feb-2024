## Why Go?
- Simplicity
    - ONLY 25 keywords
    - No access modifiers (no public/private/protected)
    - No classes (only structs)
    - No inheritance (only composition)
    - No exceptions (only errors)
    - No 'try-catch-finally'
    - No reference types (everything is a value type)
    - No pointer arithmatic
    - No implicit type conversion
    - No function overloading
- Close to hardware (performance)
    - Compiled to machine code
    - Different builds for different platforms
    - Tooling support for cross compilation
- Managed Concurrency
    - Concurrency
        - Ability to have more than one execution path
        - Concurreny is NOT parallelism
    - Concurrent operations are represented as Goroutines (not as OS threads)
    - Built in scheduler to schedule the execution of the goroutines
    - Goroutines are cheap ( ~4KB vs OS thread ~2 MB)
    - Concurrency support is built in the language
        - go keyword, channel data type, channel operator ( <- ), range & select-case constructs
    - API support
        - sync package
        - sync/atomic package

## Go Programs
### Compile & Execute
> go run [program.go]
### Compile
> go build [program.go]
> go build -o [bindary_name] [program.go]
### List the environment variables
> go env
> go env [var_1] [var_2] .....
### Set the value of environment variables
> go env -w [var_1 = value_1] [var_2 = value_2] ....
### Environment Variables for Cross Compilation
- GOARCH
- GOOS
### List the supported platforms for Cross Compilation
> go tool dist list
### Cross Compile
> GOOS=[target_os] GOARCH=[target_process_arch] go build -o [binary_name] [program.go]

## Data Types
- bool
- string
- integer types
    - int8
    - int16
    - int32
    - int64
    - int
- unsigned integer types
    - uint8
    - uint16
    - uint32
    - uint64
    - uint
- float types
    - float32
    - float64
- complex types
    - complex64 (real[float32] + imaginary[float32])
    - complex128 (real[float64] + imaginary[float64])
- type aliases
    - byte (alias for uint8)
    - rune (alias for int32 / unicode code point)

## Variables in Go
- Function Scope
    - Can use "var" & ":="
    - CANNOT have unused variables
- Package Scope
    - CANNOT use ":="
    - CAN have unused variables

## IOTA 
- constants whose values are autogenerated

## Programming Constructs
- if else
- switch case
- for
- func
